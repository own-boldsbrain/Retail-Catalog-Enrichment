# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Catalog Enrichment System

**Version:** 1.3.0
**Last Updated:** 16-Apr-2026  
**Owner:** Antonio Martinez (NVIDIA)

## Problem Statement

Product catalogs often contain minimal, low-quality information with basic product images and sparse descriptions. This limits customer engagement, search discoverability, and overall user experience. Manual enrichment of catalog data is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale. Human categorization and tagging of products is particularly susceptible to inconsistencies, subjective interpretations, and classification errors that can negatively impact search functionality and user experience.

Additionally, product catalogs quickly become outdated as market trends, customer preferences, and styling conventions evolve. Catalog managers lack visibility into how customers are actually using products in real-world contexts, what terminology resonates with target audiences, and what pros, cons, complaints, and purchase considerations appear across public web sources. This disconnect between catalog content and market reality leads to missed opportunities for engagement and conversion.

## Solution Overview

A GenAI-powered catalog enrichment system that transforms basic product images into comprehensive, rich catalog entries with enhanced titles, descriptions, categories, tags, variation images (2D/3D), and short video clips. The system uses product web research to surface public-source pros, cons, usage patterns, and customer insights, ensuring catalog managers can keep content aligned with current market context.

## Core User Flow

1. **Input**: User submits product image along with existing product JSON data and optional locale specification
2. **Content Augmentation**: System uses NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano Omni to enhance existing product data by:
   - Enriching product title with more descriptive details (localized to target region)
   - Expanding product description with richer, more verbose content (using regional terminology)
   - Improving and refining attributes (e.g., expanding "Black" to "Matte Black with Silver Hardware")
   - Enhancing categories and subcategories based on visual analysis
   - Generating more comprehensive and accurate tags
   - Validating and correcting product specifications against visual evidence
3. **Product Web Research** (Optional): System uses a Deep Agents research agent with Exa search to gather public web context for the enriched title:
   - Pros and cons reported by product pages, reviews, and relevant articles
   - Real-world usage scenarios and purchase considerations
   - Customer sentiment themes and common feedback
   - Source-backed insights for catalog managers to review
4. **Cultural Prompt Planning**: System uses NVIDIA Nemotron LLM to create culturally-aware prompts for image generation based on:
   - Product analysis
   - Target locale/country cultural context
   - Regional aesthetic preferences
5. **Localized Image Generation**: System creates variation images using FLUX models with culturally-appropriate backgrounds
6. **Quality Assessment**: System evaluates generated images using VLM-based reflection to verify:
   - Product consistency and fidelity
   - Size and scale proportions
   - Anatomical accuracy (if applicable)
   - Background quality and realism
7. **3D Asset Creation**: System generates 3D product assets using Microsoft's TRELLIS model
8. **Video Generation**: System produces 3-5 second product video clips using open-source models
9. **Output**: Culturally-enriched catalog entry with quality-assessed generated assets optimized for target market, plus a source-backed Web Insights tab for market context

### FR-10: Product FAQ Generation

- Generate 3-5 frequently asked questions and answers for each product from enriched catalog data
- FAQs are derived from the final enriched catalog data (after VLM analysis, user data merge, and branding)
- Questions cover practical shopper topics: materials, care instructions, sizing, use cases, compatibility, durability
- Answers are concise (1-3 sentences), factual, and grounded in the enriched product data
- Support locale-aware FAQ generation across all 10 supported regional locales
- Separate `/vlm/faqs` endpoint allows asynchronous generation — details display immediately while FAQs load in the background
- UI displays FAQs in a dedicated tab with collapsible accordion items

### FR-12: Product Manual PDF Enhancement for FAQs

- Accept an optional product manual PDF to enrich FAQ generation with detailed product knowledge
- Stateless architecture: `/vlm/manual/extract` processes the PDF, returns structured knowledge as JSON, and frees all server-side resources — no server-side storage required
- Dynamic query generation: LLM generates 5-8 product-type-specific questions based on title and categories (not description) to avoid FAQ duplication with the description
- Targeted RAG retrieval: text is chunked, embedded in-memory using NVIDIA nv-embedqa-e5-v5, and relevant chunks retrieved per query via cosine similarity
- When manual knowledge is provided to `/vlm/faqs`, generate up to 10 richer FAQs that surface details from the manual that go beyond the description
- FAQ prompt explicitly avoids duplicating information already in the description
- Supports concurrent processing: each request is independent with no shared server state, enabling batch processing of many products in parallel
- UI provides a "Product manual for FAQs" upload section under Advanced Options
- PDF file size limit: 50 MB; embedding requests batched at 128 chunks per call

### FR-11: Policy Compliance Checking

- Return pass/fail status with matched policies, rule details, reasons, evidence, and warnings
- Support deduplication of repeated policy uploads by content hash
- Display compliance results in the UI with visual pass/fail indicators

### FR-13: Protocol Schema Export (ACP & UCP)

- Generate ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) and UCP (Unified Commerce Protocol) schema instances from enriched product data
- Use LLM to extract structured attributes (brand, material, age_group, gender, product_details, product_highlights, short_title, google_product_category) from enriched title and description
- Merge LLM-extracted fields with enriched data and deterministic defaults (availability, condition, adult, is_bundle) into full schema templates
- ACP schema covers product, pricing, FAQs, agent actions, fulfillment, campaigns, certifications, energy efficiency, bundling, marketplace, and metadata
- UCP schema follows Google Merchant Center Product Data Specification across all 9 sections (basic product data, price/availability, product category, identifiers, detailed description, shopping campaigns, marketplaces, destinations, shipping/returns)
- UCP uses `structured_title` and `structured_description` with `digital_source_type: "trained_algorithmic_media"` for AI-generated content
- Single `/protocols/generate` endpoint calls LLM once and returns both schemas
- UI displays schemas in a Protocols tab with ACP/UCP sub-tabs, syntax-highlighted JSON, and copy-to-clipboard
- Schema generation fires in the background after FAQ generation completes, ensuring FAQs are included in both schemas

### FR-14: Product Web Insights

- Generate a source-backed product research summary from the enriched product title
- Use LangChain Deep Agents SDK as the research agent harness
- Use NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano LLM as the agent model through the existing LLM configuration
- Use Exa as the initial external web search API provider
- Search for product and brand information including pros, cons, customer feedback, real-world usage, and purchase considerations
- Return grouped insight sections: summary, pros, cons, use cases, customer insights, purchase considerations, search queries, sources, and warnings
- Keep web insights informational by default; do not automatically overwrite enriched catalog fields, FAQs, or protocol schemas
- UI displays web research in a dedicated Web Insights tab next to FAQs and Protocols
- Web insights load in the background and fail independently from FAQ generation, protocol schema generation, image generation, and 3D generation
